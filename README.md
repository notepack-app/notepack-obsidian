# NotePack for Obsidian

Todo collation with team management — an Obsidian plugin port of [notepack-cli](https://github.com/kynatro/notepack-cli).

## What It Does

NotePack scans your vault's markdown files for unchecked todos (`- [ ]`), assigns them to people via `@mention` syntax, and provides organized sidebar views. It's designed for people managers and project leads who take notes in markdown and need to track who owes what.

### Todo Assignment

Any unchecked todo without an `@mention` is assigned to **you**:

```md
- [ ] Follow up on budget review
```

Prefix with `@Name` to assign to a team member:

```md
- [ ] @Jane.Doe to write the project plan
- [ ] @John send updated timeline
```

### Due Dates

NotePack parses due dates directly from todo text. Any todo containing a recognizable due date expression will display a color-coded badge and be surfaced at the top of the sidebar views in **Overdue** and **Due Soon** sections.

#### Supported patterns

Wrap a date expression with a trigger phrase:

```md
- [ ] Submit expense report due by Friday
- [ ] @Jane.Doe review PR due on March 15
- [ ] Send invoice by EOD Monday
- [ ] Close sprint by EOM
```

Trigger phrases: `due by`, `due on`, `due at`, `due`, `by`

| Date format | Example |
|---|---|
| ISO date | `2026-03-15` |
| US date | `3/15`, `3/15/2026` |
| Named month | `March 15`, `Mar 15, 2026` |
| Relative | `today`, `tomorrow` |
| Weekday | `Friday` — nearest upcoming occurrence |
| Next weekday | `next Monday` — that weekday in the following calendar week |
| EOD | `EOD` — end of day at the configured hour |
| EOD compound | `EOD Monday`, `EOD March 15`, `EOD tomorrow` |
| EOW | `EOW`, `end of week` — last day of the configured work week at 23:59 |
| EOM | `EOM`, `end of month` — last day of the month at 23:59 |
| EOQ | `EOQ`, `end of quarter` — last day of the quarter at 23:59 |
| EOY | `EOY`, `end of year` — December 31 at 23:59 |

#### Relative date context

Relative expressions (`tomorrow`, `EOW`, `by Friday`, etc.) are resolved against the **file's date** when the filename starts with a date prefix (e.g. `2026-03-05 Standup.md`). This means a todo that said "by tomorrow" in a two-week-old note is correctly flagged as overdue rather than due tomorrow. Files without a date prefix fall back to today as the reference.

#### Urgency sections

The My todos and Team todos views sort due todos to the top:

- **Overdue** (red) — due date has passed, or EOD time has passed today
- **Due soon** (orange) — due today or within the next 7 days
- Todos with no due date, or a due date beyond 7 days, appear in the regular grouped section below with a color-coded badge indicating the date

### Team Management

Create a `Team` folder (configurable) with subfolders for each team member. Each member folder should have a `README.md` with optional front-matter:

```
Team/
  Jane Doe/
    README.md
  Johnathan Doe/
    README.md
```

In each member's `README.md`, define aliases so they can be `@mentioned` in different ways:

```yaml
---
aliases:
  - Jane
  - JD
---
```

NotePack automatically creates a `firstname.lastname` alias for every member (e.g., `@Jane.Doe`).

## Commands

Open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for "NotePack":

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Show my todos** | Opens a sidebar view with all your unassigned todos |
| **Show team todos** | Opens a sidebar view showing all team-assigned todos with member filtering |
| **Show team member todos** | Fuzzy-search a team member, then show their todos |
| **Show recent files** | Opens a sidebar view of recently modified files |
| **Export todos and recent files to file system** | Writes todo snapshots into README.md files and recent files into the root README.md |
| **Rebuild todo index** | Force a full re-index of all files |

### Sidebar Views

The three sidebar views (My todos, Team todos, Recent files) are live — they update automatically as you edit files. You can:

- Click a group heading to navigate to the source file
- Check off a todo directly from the sidebar (it updates the source file)
- Filter team todos by member using the button row

### Export Command

The export command writes a point-in-time snapshot of todos into README.md files, similar to how the original CLI's `notepack update` worked. This is useful if you sync your notes via git and want rendered README views on GitHub/GitLab. The export:

- Writes your todos to the vault root `README.md`
- Writes each team member's todos to their `Team/<Name>/README.md`
- Writes folder-scoped todos to any `README.md` found in subdirectories
- Writes recently modified files to the root `README.md`

## Settings

Configure via **Settings → NotePack**:

- **Team folder**: Path to the folder containing team member subfolders
- **Todo section title**: Heading text for the todo section (default: "Open todos")
- **Recent files section title**: Heading text for the recent files section (default: "Recent files")
- **Anchor heading level**: Markdown heading level for todo and recent file sections (default: `##`)
- **Todo group heading level**: Heading level for individual todo groups within the section (default: `####`)
- **Recent files count**: Number of recently modified files to show
- **Show un-dated files first**: When enabled, files without a date prefix are sorted above dated files in todo views (default: off)
- **End of day**: The time at which end of day due dates are considered overdue (default: 5:00 PM)
- **End of week**: The last day of the work week for end of week due dates (default: Saturday)

## File Conventions

NotePack works with any file organization, but it works best if you:

- Prefix note filenames with dates: `2024-01-15 Sprint Planning.md`
- Keep a consistent note structure with a `## Follow-up` section for todos
- Use `@Name` at the start of todos for assignment
- Use `due by <date>` or `by <date>` in todo text to set a due date
- Add `excludeTodos: true` to front-matter in files you want skipped

## Architecture (vs. CLI)

The original notepack-cli re-reads every file on every change. This plugin uses Obsidian's `metadataCache` for incremental indexing — only the changed file is re-processed. The in-memory index makes view rendering instant regardless of vault size.

| CLI | Plugin |
|-----|--------|
| `fs.readdirSync` / `fs.readFileSync` | `app.vault` API |
| `chokidar.watch` | `app.vault.on('modify')` / `metadataCache.on('changed')` |
| `front-matter` npm package | `metadataCache.getFileCache().frontmatter` |
| Full O(n) rescan on every change | O(1) incremental update per file |
| `child_process.exec('find ...')` | `app.vault.getMarkdownFiles()` |
| Console output | Sidebar leaf views |
| `README.md` live-writing | On-demand export command |

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev    # Watch mode (esbuild)
pnpm run build  # Production build
```

Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/notepack/` folder. Alternatively, symlink the entire project to the `.obsidian/plugins` folder to take advantage of hot reloading in Obsidian with the [hot-reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin.

### Releasing

This project uses `dev` as the main branch and synchronizes `main` via a fast-forward merge when doing a release.

#### Workflow

1. Work out of branches for any feature or fix
2. Prefix feature branches with `feature/` and fixes with `maint/`
3. Create a PR with the branch work against `dev`
4. Squash merge the PR when all checks have passed

#### Cut a new release

When `dev` is ready for a new release run `pnpm version` with the appropriate semver increase. You must run this command from the `dev` branch and the `dev` branch must not have any outstanding changes or be out of sync with `origin/dev`. If anything is out of order, you will be prompted to fix before being allowed to proceed.

Running the `version` script will automatically make sure tests and build succeed, synchronize changes between `dev` and `master`, cut a new tag and push to `origin/dev`. From there the [`release`](./.github/workflows/release.yml) GitHub Action will take over and create a Release.
